# Wiki Schema

## Domain
**General-purpose knowledge wiki** — anything worth remembering, cross-referencing, and building on. Covers AI/ML research, projects and codebases, hobbies and interests, personal knowledge (health, finance, etc.), and competitive/product landscapes. The only constraint is: if it's interesting enough to revisit, it belongs here.

## Conventions
- **File names:** lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (`transformer-architecture.md`)
- **Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter** (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages synthesizing 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]` at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source
- **Immutability:** Files in `raw/` are never edited. Corrections go in wiki pages
- **Duplication avoidance:** Always search index + existing pages before creating new ones

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
tags: [from taxonomy below]
sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
# Optional quality signals:
confidence: high | medium | low
contested: true
contradictions: [other-page-slug]
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
New tags must be added here before use.

**Topics:**
- ai-ml (models, architectures, training, fine-tuning, inference, alignment)
- research (papers, benchmarks, evaluations, literature)
- engineering (codebases, projects, tooling, infrastructure, devops)
- personal (health, finance, lifestyle, goals)
- competitive (products, companies, markets, landscape)
- hobby (interests, creative, gaming, etc.)

**Types:**
- entity (person, company, product, tool, organization)
- concept (idea, technique, method, theory)
- comparison (side-by-side analysis)
- query (filed answer to a question)
- summary (synthesized overview of a topic)

**Attributes:**
- stale (needs review or update)
- contested (has unresolved contradictions)
- archived (superseded, moved to _archive/)

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or one-off facts
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines
- **Archive a page** when fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review

## Raw Source Frontmatter
Sources in `raw/` also get frontmatter for drift detection:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://example.com/article
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
sha256: <hex digest of body only>
---
```
